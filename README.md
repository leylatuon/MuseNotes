# MuseNotes
MuseNotes is a music journaling app. Users will be able to journal about their day and attach a song to the entry to represent their day or pull their most played song from the current day. The premise of this app is that for some their mood affects what type of music they listen to and sometimes certain tracks can jog memories of a certain period in your life, this combined with journaling can help create a more holistic snapshot of a period of time that a user can look back on. 

As of now you can write, edit, and delete entries. You can also search and attach a song reference, with artist name, album art, and song title using the Spotify API to a journal entry. The settings allow users to switch to dark mode.
